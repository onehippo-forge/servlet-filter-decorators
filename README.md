# Hippo Servlet Filter Decorators Plugin

Decorate ServletRequest 

# Documentation 

Documentation is available at [bloomreach-forge.github.io/servlet-filter-decorators/](https://bloomreach-forge.github.io/servlet-filter-decorators/)


The documentation is generated by this command from the master branch:

 > mvn clean site:site -Pgithub.pages 
 
The output is in the ```/docs``` directory; push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically. 

For rendering documentation on non-master branches, use the normal site command so the output will be in the ```/target``` 
and therefore ignored by Git.

 > mvn clean site:site
